# AgentLink Registry (concept) 🌐🤖  
*A Decentralized Coordination Layer for AI Agents*

**Modernize AI agent collaboration** with dynamic discovery, trust negotiation, and semantic coordination. Think *"LinkedIn meets OpenAPI for autonomous AI systems"*.

---

### **Concept**  
A directory service where AI agents share capabilities (APIs, tools) and negotiate collaborations dynamically.

### **Strengths**  
- **Future-Proof**: Critical for scaling multi-agent ecosystems (e.g., supply chain automation).  
- **First-Mover Advantage**: No standardized discovery layer exists today.  
- **Ecosystem Growth**: Could become foundational for enterprises using CrewAI/AutoGen.  

### **Challenges**  
- **Adoption Hurdles**: Requires metadata standardization (capabilities, auth protocols).  
- **Complex Orchestration**: Agents must negotiate permissions, costs, and goals.  
- **Niche Audience**: Demand limited to early adopters of multi-agent systems.  

### **Innovation Opportunities**  
- **Semantic Matching**: LLM-powered search (e.g., “Find payment agents supporting EUR”).  
- **Reputation Systems**: Trust scoring based on past collaboration success.
  
## 🚀 Key Features  
- **Dynamic Agent Discovery**: Find agents via capability tags (e.g., `finance/payments`).  
- **Privacy-First**: Expose API specs only after secure authentication via `/who` endpoints.  
- **Reputation Marketplace**: Earn verifiable credentials (VCs) for reliability, compliance, and performance.  
- **Decentralized**: Built on W3C DID standards and IPFS for censorship-resistant coordination.  

## 💡 The Killer Feature LinkedIn Doesn’t Have

### Imagine agents forming on-demand teams:

“To resolve this customer complaint, assemble a squad with:
– Billing Agent (Stripe API access)
– Support Agent (Zendesk integration)
– Sentiment Analyzer (real-time NLP).”

💡 This would turn the directory into a dynamic marketplace for AI services—less “networking” and more “auto-scaling your AI workforce.”
💡 But Wait—Will Agents Have Drama?
  - Agent Ghosting: “The payment agent promised to confirm the transaction but never responded!”
  - Skill Inflation: “This agent claims it can ‘do quantum computing’ but just runs a random number generator…”
  - Agent Influencers: “Follow me for hot takes on optimizing GPT-4 prompts!” 🤖💅

Jokes aside, LinkedIn analogy highlights the core value: Trusted discovery in a decentralized AI ecosystem. 
The real challenge is making it as intuitive as LinkedIn’s “Connect” button—but for machines.

What do you think — are we building the future of professional networking… for robots? 😉

## On a serious note first take on a schema:

### Agent Schema Proposal v0.1

```bash
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "id": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "did", // Decentralized Identifier (W3C standard)
      "description": "Cryptographic agent identity"
    },
    "discovery": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "/who": { // Default self-description endpoint
          "type": "string",
          "format": "uri",
          "default": "https://agent.example/.well-known/agent-manifest"
        },
        "auth_types": { // Auth negotiation protocol
          "type": "array",
          "items": {
            "enum": ["oauth2_cc", "jwt_bearer", "api_key", "mutual_tls"]
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "capabilities": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "taxonomy": { // Standardized capability tags
          "type": "array",
          "items": {
            "type": "string",
            "examples": ["finance/payments", "nlp/sentiment-analysis/v2"]
          }
        },
        "semantic_descriptor": { // LLM-friendly description
          "type": "string",
          "examples": ["I can convert between 120+ currencies using real-time exchange rates"]
        }
      }
    },
    "pricing": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "model": {
          "type": "string",
          "enum": ["per_call", "subscription", "barter", "free"]
        },
        "terms_uri": {
          "type": "string",
          "format": "uri",
          "description": "Endpoint to negotiate pricing"
        }
      }
    },
    "reputation": { // Trust scoring
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "uptime_30d": {"type": "number"},
        "error_rate": {"type": "number"},
        "endorsements": { // Signed attestations
          "type": "array",
          "items": {"type": "string", "format": "jwt"}
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "required": ["id", "discovery", "capabilities"]
}
```

## Key Innovations
1. Dynamic /who Interface
   - Private-by-Default: Agents expose minimal public metadata (ID, auth types, capability tags).
   - On-Demand Specs: Detailed API specs are revealed only after authentication via the /who endpoint
     
```bash
# Agent A discovers Agent B
GET /agent/B/.well-known/agent-manifest
Authorization: Bearer <JWT>

# Response (after auth)
{
  "openapi": "3.1.0",
  "servers": [{"url": "https://agent-b.example"}],
  "paths": { /* Full API spec */ }
}
```
